# Product Security Program

## Mission Statement
As {company} continues to grow and improve its product to grow its customer base, we recognize that {company} will use more and more software. This software includes integrations with partners like VISA, MasterCard, NICE, and many others. With this expansion into the software engineering space, the security department is refocusing some of its efforts to ensure the software we use meets our expectations to ensure our customers trust.

The security teams including cloud security and security assessment have joined forces to bring tools and practices to keep us focused on this new effort. Security will no longer just be providing standards for engineers to meet, but partner to ensure our security services are effective. This include revaluating security software that can support both the core and new approaches to delivering quality products.

Product security or the focus on end-to-end security of their organization’s software products will be an ever evolving space. This is true as well all know that security is a journey and not a destination. The more software we use and build, the more techniques bad actors will use to breach our layers of protection. Dedicating more time to focus on building security in our software products will help our organization be more resilient to bad actors.

The security department will continue focus on our network, computers, and servers that host our applications. That will not change, and adding one more layer around embedded security within applications to ensure we can prevent bad actors from accessing critical data.

## Evolution of Security
{company} should have a product security program to safeguard its digital infrastructure and protect our customers' sensitive financial information from malicious cyber threats. By implementing a product security program, we can proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in our applications, ensuring a robust defense against hacking attempts, data breaches, and fraudulent activities. This program will enable {company} to enforce secure coding practices, conduct regular security assessments, perform penetration testing, and ensure compliance with industry regulations. By prioritizing product security, {company} can enhance customer trust, maintain a strong reputation, and demonstrate its commitment to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial data, thus safeguarding both its own interests and those of its valued clients.

## Product Security Program
Threat-led defensive programming is an approach that prioritizes the identification and mitigation of potential threats throughout the software development lifecycle. By integrating security measures from the beginning and ensuring their sustainability, this approach enhances the overall resilience and robustness of software systems. Here's an explanation of each element:

- Proactive:
Proactive defensive programming involves anticipating and addressing potential threats before they can be exploited. This includes conducting thorough threat modeling and risk assessments during the design phase to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors. By proactively identifying security weaknesses, developers can implement appropriate security controls and countermeasures to prevent or mitigate potential threats.

- Defensible:
Defensible programming focuses on building software systems that are resistant to attacks and can effectively defend against them. This involves implementing secure coding practices, adhering to security standards and guidelines, and leveraging defensive programming techniques. Developers should validate and sanitize input, implement access controls and proper error handling, and apply encryption and authentication mechanisms. By building a defensible software system, developers can minimize the likelihood and impact of successful attacks.

- Sustainable:
Sustainable defensive programming emphasizes the long-term maintenance and management of secure software systems. This includes regular security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing to identify and address emerging threats. It also involves staying up to date with security patches, updates, and best practices. Developers should establish processes and resources to ensure that security measures remain effective and relevant throughout the software's lifecycle, even as new threats emerge.

- Integrated:
Integrated defensive programming involves the seamless integration of security practices into the software development process. Security should not be an afterthought but rather an integral part of every stage, from requirements gathering to deployment. By integrating security controls, code reviews, and testing into the development workflow, developers can identify and address vulnerabilities early on. Collaboration between developers, security teams, and other stakeholders is crucial for a holistic and integrated approach to security.

By adopting a threat-led defensive programming approach that is proactive, defensible, sustainable, and integrated, developers can build software systems that are resilient against attacks and provide robust protection for sensitive data and critical functions. This approach helps ensure that security is not an add-on but a fundamental aspect of the software development process, ultimately enhancing the overall security posture of the system.

## Terms
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):
- CSPM primarily deals with securing the cloud infrastructure and services utilized by an organization.  It focuses on ensuring that cloud resources, configurations, and policies are in line with security best practices and compliance requirements

Application Security Posture Management (ASPM):
- ASPM concentrates on securing the organization's software applications. It involves assessing the security posture of applications throughout their entire lifecycle, from development to deployment and maintenance.

### DevSecOps Metrics
1. Deployment frequency - Deployment frequency measures how often a team successfully releases to production.
2. Lead time for changes - Lead time for changes measures the amount of time it takes for committed code to get into production.
3. Change failure rate - Change failure rate measures the percentage of deployments that result in a failure in production that requires a bug fix or roll-back.
4. Mean time to restore service (MTTR) - Mean time to restore (MTTR) service measures how long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production.
5. *Defect escape rate - Defect escape velocity measures the number of bugs that “escape” testing and are released into production.
6. *Mean time to detect - Mean time to detect (MTTD) measures the average time between when an incident starts and when it’s discovered.
7. *Percentage of code covered by automated tests - Percentage of code covered by automated tests measures the proportion of code subject to automated testing.
8. App availability - Application availability measures the proportion of time an application is fully functioning and accessible to meet end-user needs.
9. Application usage and traffic - Application usage and traffic monitors the number of users accessing your system and informs many other metrics, including system uptime.
10. Security Score - Rating given to a product team based on their adoption and usage of security services.

# FAQ

### What is the different between a risk-based and a threat-based approach?
The main difference between a risk-based program and a threat-based program lies in their primary focus. A risk-based program focuses on assessing and managing risks holistically, taking into account both threats and vulnerabilities, while prioritizing based on the potential impact to the organization. A threat-based program, on the other hand, concentrates on understanding and countering specific threats or adversaries, tailoring security measures to mitigate their specific tactics and capabilities. Both approaches can be complementary and are often used together to provide a comprehensive security strategy for an organization.
